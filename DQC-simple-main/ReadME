Packages needed to run the program can be found in packages.txt

Inputs: 
  -A folder containing input circuits. 
  -An example circuit is provided.
  
Format of input files:

  Line 1 is of the form:

    Inputs: 0:Qbit, 1:Qbit, 2:Qbit, 3:Qbit, ... , n:Qbit

  Every subsequent line is either a Hadamard gate on some qubit q:

    QGate["H"](q)

  Or a CZ gate on some qubits q1 and q2:

    QGate["CZ"](q1) with controls=[+q2]
