Packages needed to run the program can be found in packages.txt

Inputs: 
  -A folder containing input circuits. 
  -An example circuit is provided.
  
Format of input files:

  Line 1 is of the form:

    Inputs: 0:Qbit, 1:Qbit, 2:Qbit, 3:Qbit, ... , n:Qbit

  Every subsequent line is either a Hadamard gate on some qubit q:

    QGate["H"](q)

  Or a CZ gate on some qubits q1 and q2:

    QGate["CZ"](q1) with controls=[+q2]

Running the code:

  Place the input circuit file in the Inputs folder. Then, run the code as follows:

    python3 MainFile.py
    
      Function input options:

      1. OM


      2. G star simple


      3. G star LP


      Enter Option:  1 or 2 or 3
      
      Enter Input Filename: example.txt
      
      Enter number of partitions: some k in {1...n}

  The result will be stored in 'Results' under the same file name. The result file corresponding to running OM algorithm on example.txt with 5 partitions is as follows:

    Original Circuit: 
    qubits: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]
    gates: 1000
    num of CZ: 500
    partitions: [[2, 7, 8, 18], [6, 12, 14, 19], [0, 11, 13, 16], [1, 10, 15, 17], [3, 4, 5, 9]]
    number of partitions: 5
    size: 5
    cost: 218
    maximum number of ebits in partition: 7
